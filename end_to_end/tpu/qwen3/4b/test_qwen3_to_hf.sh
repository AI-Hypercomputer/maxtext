# This file is both an integration test that runs once a day on a v4-8 and documentation for how to get started with Qwen3-4B.

# The flow of this file is as follows:
# 1. Convert the checkpoint downloaded from Hugging Face to make it compatible with MaxText
# 2. Run a forward pass check to compare the logits and KL divergence between the converted ckpt and orginal golden HF model
