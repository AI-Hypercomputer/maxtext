# Llama4

â€‹Meta's Llama 4 is the latest generation of its open-source large language models (LLMs), unveiled in April 2025. These models are designed to be natively multimodal and multilingual, incorporating a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to enhance performance and efficiency.  The currently supported models are:
* LLama4 Scout (17B-16E)
* Llama4 Scout (17B-16E-Instruct)


## Checkpoint conversion
Currently, we support converting PyTorch (`.pth`) checkpoints, which can be downloaded from Meta [here](https://www.llama.com/).

Once you have downloaded the Scout models, you can run the following command to generate an unscanned checkpoint (preferred for decoding):

```
JAX_PLATFORMS=CPU python -m MaxText.llama4_ckpt_unscanned.py --base-model-path [PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT_DIR] --maxtext-model-path [DESIRED_MAXTEXT_CHECKPOINT_OUTPUT_DIR]  --model-size llama4-17b-16e
```


## Decoding
In order to run an example decoding, you can use a command such as the following:

```
python -m MaxText.decode MaxText/configs/base.yml scan_layers=false base_output_directory=... load_parameters_path=... run_name=... model_name=llama4-17b-16e force_unroll=false weight_dtype=bfloat16 sparse_matmul=false megablox=false tokenizer_path="meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E"  max_target_length=16 max_prefill_predict_length=4 per_device_batch_size=2 prompt="I love to" attention=dot_product
```

## Supported MoE strategy
* Dropless
  * General dense matmul implementation with flag `sparse_matmul=False capacity_factor=-1`.
  * Support for `megablox` and `ragged_dot` is coming soon!
