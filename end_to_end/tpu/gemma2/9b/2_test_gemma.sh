# This file is both an integration test that runs once a day on a v4-16 and documentation for how to get started with Gemma2-9b. 
# Please make sure you have run end_to_end/tpu/gemma2/9b/1_test_gemma.sh before running commands from this file. 

# The flow of this file is as follows:
# 1. Run decoding, finetuning of Gemma2 9b with the converted checkpoint obtained from end_to_end/tpu/gemma2/9b/1_test_gemma.sh. Also, run pretraining of Gemma2 9b
# 2. Convert the scanned checkpoint from step 1 into unscanned checkpoint format and run more efficient decoding.
# 3. Run decoding from the finetuned checkpoint from step 1
# 4. Ahead of Time Compilation for running Gemma2 9b on v5e-256

# Example Usage: export BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/path/to/GCS/bucket; bash end_to_end/tpu/gemma2/9b/1_test_gemma.sh
# Use the same BASE_OUTPUT_PATH as end_to_end/tpu/gemma2/9b/1_test_gemma.sh
# Please note that in these two scripts (1_test_gemma.sh and 2_test_gemma.sh) BASE_OUTPUT_PATH is assumed to be already a unique path across multiple runs and 
# the subfolders names aka RUN_NAMEs are static. Please remember to change BASE_OUTPUT_PATH across different runs.
