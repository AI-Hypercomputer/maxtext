# Mixtral

[Mixtral](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/) is a state-of-the-art AI model developed by Mistral AI, utilizing a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.


To get started, follow the instructions at [mistral-inference](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference) to download the model. Once downloaded, run [llama_or_mistral_ckpt.py](../../../MaxText/llama_or_mistral_ckpt.py) to convert the checkpoint for MaxText compatibility. You can then proceed with decoding, pretraining, and finetuning. You could find Mixtral 8x7B example in the [end_to_end/tpu/mixtral/8x7b](../mixtral/8x7b) test scripts.


Additionally, Mixtral integrates with [MegaBlocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15841), an efficient dropless MoE strategy, which can be activated by setting the megablox flag to True (default).


## MaxText supports pretraining and finetuning with high performance
