# Try SFT
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a process where a pre-trained large language model is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset to adapt the model to perform better on specific tasks.

This tutorial demonstrates step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment and then training the Llama3.1 8B model on the [HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k) dataset using SFT. If you wish to use a different dataset, you can [update the dataset configurations](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/src/MaxText/configs/sft.yml).

We use [Tunix](https://github.com/google/tunix), a JAX-based library designed for post-training tasks, to perform SFT.

In this tutorial we use a single host TPU VM such as `v6e-8/v5p-8`. Let's get started!

## Setup virtual environment

### Create a Python3.12 virtual environment
```
bash setup.sh
```

### Activate virtual environment
```
# Replace with your virtual environment name if not using this default name
venv_name="maxtext_venv"
source ~/$venv_name/bin/activate
```

### Install MaxText dependencies
```
bash setup.sh
```

## Run SFT
There are two scenarios supported for running SFT:
1. **Run SFT on Hugging Face checkpoint**
    Download the checkpoint directly from Hugging Face and fine-tune it using SFT.

2. **Run SFT on MaxText checkpoint**
    Use a checkpoint generated by MaxText and fine-tune it using SFT.

Choose the scenario that matches your workflow and follow the corresponding instructions below.

### Run SFT on Hugging Face checkpoint
* The script will first convert a Hugging Face checkpoint to a MaxText checkpoint.
* It then runs SFT on this converted checkpoint.

#### Setup environment variables
```
 export HF_TOKEN=<Hugging Face access token>

 export BASE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=<output directory to store run logs>

 export STEPS=<number of fine-tuning steps to run>

 export PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE=1
```

Finally, run the [script](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/end_to_end/tpu/llama3.1/8b/run_sft.sh):
```
bash ~/maxtext/end_to_end/tpu/llama3.1/8b/run_sft.sh
```

### Run SFT on MaxText checkpoint
* The script directly runs SFT on MaxText checkpoint.

#### Setup environment variables
```
 export HF_TOKEN=<Hugging Face access token>

 export BASE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=<output directory to store run logs>

 export STEPS=<number of fine-tuning steps to run>

 export PER_DEVICE_BATCH_SIZE=1

 export PRE_TRAINED_MODEL_CKPT_PATH=<gcs path for MaxText checkpoint>
```

Finally, run the [script](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/end_to_end/tpu/llama3.1/8b/run_sft.sh):
```
bash ~/maxtext/end_to_end/tpu/llama3.1/8b/run_sft.sh
```
