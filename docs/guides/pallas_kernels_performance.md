# Performance Optimizations with Pallas Kernels

## Introduction

While JAX and the XLA compiler provide excellent out-of-the-box performance, writing custom kernels with Pallas, a JAX extension for GPUs and TPUs, can unlock even greater speed. Pallas allows for lower-level control over hardware execution, which is especially beneficial for memory-bound operations. This guide provides an overview of writing and integrating custom Pallas kernels to optimize MaxText's performance.

## Benefits of Using Pallas

While the XLA compiler is highly effective, Pallas provides a powerful tool for expert users to unlock additional performance in specific scenarios. Key benefits include:

* **Operator Fusion**: Manually fuse multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce launch overhead and memory I/O, especially when XLA's automatic fusion is suboptimal.
* **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Tailor code to the specific architecture of your GPU or TPU, leveraging features that the compiler might not fully utilize. This includes fine-grained control over memory access and parallelism.
* **Improved Memory Access Patterns**: With Pallas, you can optimize how data is read from and written to memory to maximize bandwidth and reduce latency.
* **Algorithmic Optimizations**: Implement novel algorithms not available in standard libraries, such as flash attention, which combines the benefits of the above points to significantly speed up attention and save memory.

### When Not to Use Pallas

Pallas is a specialized tool and not always the right choice. Stick with standard JAX in these scenarios:

* **When XLA is Sufficient**: If profiling shows your code is already efficient, a custom kernel adds complexity for little gain. **Always profile first.**
* **For Purely Compute-Bound Operations**: Pallas excels at memory-bound problems. For large, compute-bound operations like `jnp.matmul`, it's hard to beat XLA's highly optimized library calls.
* **If Maintainability is a Top Priority**: Pallas kernels are lower-level and harder to debug. If the performance gain is marginal, the maintenance overhead may not be worth it.
* **Without a Clear Bottleneck**: Avoid premature optimization. Use Pallas only after profiling has identified a specific, memory-bound bottleneck.


## Getting Started with Pallas Kernels

### Writing a Custom Kernel

Pallas kernels are Python functions decorated with `@pallas.kernel` that use JAX APIs to operate on `Ref` objects, which are references to JAX arrays. Inside a kernel, you have direct control over reading from and writing to these references.

**Example Kernel:**

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax.experimental import pallas as pl

@pl.kernel
def add_vectors_kernel(x_ref, y_ref, o_ref):
  x = x_ref[:]
  y = y_ref[:]
  o_ref[:] = x + y

def add_vectors(x: jax.Array, y: jax.Array) -> jax.Array:
  return pl.pallas_call(
      add_vectors_kernel,
      out_shape=jax.ShapeDtypeStruct(shape=x.shape, dtype=x.dtype),
  )(x, y)
```

For a deeper dive, see the [Pallas Quickstart guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pallas/quickstart.html).

### Integration Steps

* **Define the kernel**: Write the Pallas kernel function.
* **Create a wrapper**: Write a function that invokes the kernel using `pallas_call`.
* **Replace in MaxText**: Substitute the original JAX operation in the MaxText code with your new wrapper function.


### Advanced Topics

#### Understanding Pallas on TPU

On TPUs, Pallas kernels are compiled using **Mosaic**. When a Pallas kernel is called, its inputs are loaded from High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) into the TPU's fast, on-chip **Vector Memory (VMEM)**. The computations within the kernel are performed on data residing in VMEM.

TPUs have two main compute units:

* **Vector Unit (VPU)**: Executes element-wise operations.
* **Matrix Unit (MXU)**: Specialized for large matrix multiplications and convolutions.

Understanding this memory hierarchy and the different compute units is key to writing high-performance kernels. For more information, refer to the JAX documentation on [Pallas TPU details](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/tpu/details.html).

#### Kernel Tuning and Pipelining

Tuning is essential for achieving optimal performance. A key technique is **pipelining**, which hides memory access latency by overlapping computation with data transfers from HBM to VMEM. Pallas offers two main ways to implement this.

##### Pipelining via Grid Iteration

Instead of an explicit loop inside a kernel, you can define an iteration space using the `grid` argument in `pallas_call`. Pallas unrolls this grid into a series of kernel invocations. The Pallas runtime, especially with a `pltpu.PrefetchScalarGridSpec`, schedules these invocations and their memory transfers to overlap, effectively creating a pipeline. This is the approach used in MaxText kernels like `megablox/gmm.py`.

* **When to use**: Prefer `grid` with `PrefetchScalarGridSpec` for independent tiles as it provides simple, automatic pipelining.

##### Pipelining with `pallas.for_loop`

For more complex scenarios, you can use an explicit `pallas.for_loop` inside your kernel. This is not a standard Python loop; it's a specific instruction to the compiler to create a pipelined schedule. It gives you fine-grained control to manage the state carried between iterations, which is necessary for more advanced pipelining patterns.

* **When to use**: Use `pallas.for_loop` for stateful operations or when there are dependencies carried between loop iterations.

For more information, refer to the JAX documentation on [Pallas TPU pipelining](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/tpu/pipelining.html).

#### Block Sizes & Other Parameters

* **Block Sizes**: The `BlockSpec` defines data tiling and is critical for performance. Start with a baseline (e.g., `(1024, 1024)` on TPUs), experiment with powers of two, and profile to find the optimal size for your hardware.
* **Grid Size**: The `grid` parameter sets the number of kernel instances. Tune it to balance parallelism and overhead.
* **Memory Spaces**: Use VMEM for intermediate results to reduce latency.
* **Compiler Parameters**: The `compiler_params` argument can pass additional flags to the Mosaic compiler for specific optimizations.


### Distributed Execution with `shard_map`

Pallas kernels can be seamlessly used in distributed environments with `jax.experimental.shard_map`. This allows you to run your custom kernels across a `Mesh` of devices, which is essential for large-scale training with MaxText. When using `shard_map`, you specify how your data is partitioned across the devices using the `in_specs` and `out_specs` arguments. For more details, see the JAX documentation on [distributed Pallas kernels](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/tpu/distributed.html).


### Pallas Kernels in MaxText

MaxText includes several Pallas kernels that serve as excellent references:

* **Splash Attention**: `MaxText/layers/attention_op.py` (utilizes Jax's [splash\_attention\_kernel](https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/jax/experimental/pallas/ops/tpu/splash_attention/splash_attention_kernel.py))
* **Ragged Attention**: `MaxText/kernels/ragged_attention.py`
* **MegaBlox**: `MaxText/kernels/megablox/gmm.py`
