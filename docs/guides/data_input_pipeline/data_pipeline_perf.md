# Data input pipeline performance

This guide explains how to set and verify the performance goal for your data input pipeline to maximize accelerator utilization.

## The goal: overlap data loading and computation

The primary performance goal is simple: **data loading on the CPU must be faster than computation on the accelerator (TPU/GPU)**.

Ideally, while the accelerator is busy with the current step's computation (e.g., `Matmul`), the CPU is already prefetching data for the _future_ step(s). This overlap, shown in the following image, ensures the accelerator never has to wait for data.

If data loading is faster than computation, the pipeline is not a bottleneck. Optimizing it further will **not** improve training speed.

## Prerequisite: asynchronous execution

For this overlap to happen, the data pipeline (on the CPU) and the model computation (on the accelerator) must execute in parallel. You can verify this using a profiler.
* **Good (parallel)**: The trace on the right shows the CPU (bottom tracks) is busy fetching data at the same time the TPU (top track) is computing.
* **Bad (sequential)**: The trace on the left shows a **gap** in TPU utilization, where the TPU is idle. This gap is often caused by **forcing synchronization** (as explained in the following section), not necessarily a slow pipeline. While speeding up data loading might narrow this gap, only removing the synchronization eliminates the gap and achieves true parallelism.

## Common pitfall: forcing synchronization

JAX's asynchronous dispatch allows the CPU to run ahead. However, this parallelism breaks if your host code (Python) tries to access the result of a computation before it's finished.
* **Example**: Calling `print(loss)` or `.block_until_ready()` on a JAX array from the current step forces the host to wait for the accelerator, stalling the data pipeline.
* **MaxText solution**: MaxText avoids this by using a metrics cache. It only prints the loss from the previous step, allowing the current step's computation and the next step's data loading to proceed in parallel (see [buffer_and_write_train_metrics()](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/1c6f5a26dc155262d2ebdd68223397107dfd4b95/src/MaxText/metric_logger.py#L193) in `metric_logger.py`).

## How to test your pipeline

You can check if your data pipeline meets the performance goal in two ways:
1. **Check the profile**: Look for gaps in the accelerator trace (like the "Bad" example above). If there are no gaps, your data loading is likely fast enough.
2. **Run in isolation**: You can benchmark training and dataloading separately with the following steps: run your training workload with synthetic data (`dataset_type=synthetic`) to get a target_step_time time; use a script (like `standalone_dataloader.py`) to time how long it takes to load data batches without training. If your data_loading_time is consistently less than your target_step_time, your data pipeline is not the bottleneck. However, if your step time with _real data_ is still slower than your target_step_time, it strongly suggests a forced synchronization issue.

## How to speed up a slow data pipeline

If your profile confirms that data loading is parallel but still slower than computation, then data loading is the bottleneck. Here are a few ways to speed it up:
1. **Tune Grain**: If you are using the [Grain data pipeline](data_input_grain.md), start by tuning the `grain_worker_count`. If adjusting the worker count isn't enough, use the [Grain performance and debugging tool](https://google-grain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dataset_debugging_tutorial.html) to find the specific bottleneck.
2. **Pre-process offline**: Perform as much data preparation as possible offline. Apply only light-weight preprocessing during training.
