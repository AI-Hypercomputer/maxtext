# Install MaxText

This document discusses how to install MaxText. We recommend installing MaxText inside a Python virtual environment.

## From PyPI (Recommended)
This is the easiest way to get started with the latest stable version.

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed maxtext_venv
source maxtext_venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install uv, a fast Python package installer
pip install uv

# 3. Install MaxText and its dependencies
uv pip install maxtext --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```
> **Note:** The `install_maxtext_github_deps` command is temporarily required to install dependencies directly from GitHub that are not yet available on PyPI.

> **Note:** The maxtext package contains a comprehensive list of all direct and transitive dependencies, with lower bounds, generated by [seed-env](https://github.com/google-ml-infra/actions/tree/main/python_seed_env). We highly recommend the `--resolution=lowest` flag. It instructs `uv` to install the specific, tested versions of dependencies defined by MaxText, rather than the latest available ones. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, which is critical for stable performance and for running benchmarks.

## From Source
If you plan to contribute to MaxText or need the latest unreleased features, install from source.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext.git
cd maxtext

# 2. Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed maxtext_venv
source maxtext_venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies in editable mode
pip install uv
# install the tpu package
uv pip install -e .[tpu] --resolution=lowest
# or install the gpu package by running the following line
# uv pip install -e .[cuda12] --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

After installation, you can verify the package is available with `python3 -c "import MaxText"` and run training jobs with `python3 -m MaxText.train ...`.
