# How to load the data

Maxtext supports input data pipelines in the following ways:

- Tf.data[^1]
- Grain
- Hugging Face Datasets

[^1]: Tf.data is the most performant way of loading large scale datasets.

You can read more about the pipelines in [Data Input Pipeline](https://github.com/AI-Hypercompute/maxtext/blob/main/docs/advanced_docs/Data_Input_Pipeline.md).
