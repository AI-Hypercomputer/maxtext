# Update MaxText dependencies

## Introduction

This document provides a guide to updating dependencies in MaxText using the `seed-env` tool. `seed-env` helps generate deterministic and reproducible Python environments by creating fully-pinned `requirements.txt` files from a base set of requirements.

## Overview of the Process

To update dependencies, you will follow these general steps:

1.  **Modify Base Requirements**: Update the desired dependencies in `base_requirements/requirements.txt` or the hardware-specific files (`base_requirements/tpu-base-requirements.txt`, `base_requirements/gpu-base-requirements.txt`).
2.  **Generate New Files**: Run the `seed-env` CLI tool to generate new, fully-pinned requirements files based on your changes.
3.  **Update Project Files**: Copy the newly generated files into the `generated_requirements/` directory.
4.  **Handle GitHub Dependencies**: Move any dependencies that are installed directly from GitHub from the generated files to `src/install_maxtext_extra_deps/extra_deps_from_github.txt`.
5.  **Verify**: Test the new dependencies to ensure the project installs and runs correctly.

The following sections provide detailed instructions for each step.

## Step 1: Install seed-env

First, you need to install the `seed-env` command-line tool by running `pip install seed-env uv`. Or follow the instructions in the
[seed-env repository](https://github.com/google-ml-infra/actions/tree/main/python_seed_env#install-the-seed-env-tool) if you want to build `seed-env` from source.

## Step 2: Find the JAX Build Commit Hash

The dependency generation process is pinned to a specific nightly build of JAX. You need to find the commit hash for the desired JAX build.

You can find the latest commit hashes in the [JAX `build/` folder](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/commits/main/build). Choose a recent, successful build and copy its full commit hash.

## Step 3: Generate the Requirements Files

Next, run the `seed-env` CLI to generate the new requirements files. You will need to do this separately for the TPU and GPU environments. The generated files will be placed in a directory specified by `--output-dir`.

### For TPU

Run the following command, replacing `<jax-build-commit-hash>` with the hash you copied in the previous step.

```bash
seed-env \
  --local-requirements=base_requirements/tpu-base-requirements.txt \
  --host-name=MaxText \
  --seed-commit=<jax-build-commit-hash> \
  --python-version=3.12 \
  --requirements-txt=tpu-requirements.txt \
  --output-dir=generated_tpu_artifacts
```

### For GPU

Similarly, run the command for the GPU requirements.

```bash
seed-env \
  --local-requirements=base_requirements/cuda12-base-requirements.txt \
  --host-name=MaxText \
  --seed-commit=<jax-build-commit-hash> \
  --python-version=3.12 \
  --requirements-txt=cuda12-requirements.txt \
  --hardware=cuda12 \
  --output-dir=generated_gpu_artifacts
```

## 4. Update Project Files

After generating the new requirements, you need to update the files in the MaxText repository.

1.  **Copy the generated files:**
    -   Move `generated_tpu_artifacts/tpu-requirements.txt` to `generated_requirements/tpu-requirements.txt`.
    -   Move `generated_gpu_artifacts/cuda12-requirements.txt` to `generated_requirements/cuda12-requirements.txt`.

2.  **Update `extra_deps_from_github.txt` (if necessary):**
    Currently, MaxText uses a few dependencies, such as `mlperf-logging` and `google-jetstream`, that are installed directly from GitHub source. These are defined in `base_requirements/requirements.txt`, and the `seed-env` tool will carry them over to the generated requirements files.

## 5. Verify the New Dependencies

Finally, test that the new dependencies install correctly and that MaxText runs as expected.

1.  **Create a clean environment:** It's best to start with a fresh Python virtual environment.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed maxtext_venv
source maxtext_venv/bin/activate
```

2.  **Run the setup script:** Execute `bash setup.sh` to install the new dependencies.

```bash
pip install uv
# install the tpu package
uv pip install -e .[tpu] --resolution=lowest
# or install the gpu package by running the following line:
# uv pip install -e .[cuda12] --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

3.  **Run tests:** Run MaxText tests to ensure there are no regressions.
