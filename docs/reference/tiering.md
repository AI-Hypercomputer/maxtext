# MaxText Optimized Models Tiering

For each of the TPU platforms listed below, we present a list of optimized models[^1] [^2] for pre-training. If youâ€™re getting started with MaxText, or want to push performance, we recommend choosing a Gold model, with an accompanying pre-training recipe.

- **Gold Tier**: Fully Optimized Models certified to run with maximum efficiency on Cloud TPUs. They are thoroughly refined for the highest possible performance, making them ideal for production-critical workloads requiring peak throughput.

- **Silver Tier**: High Performance Models that are well-optimized to deliver high, reliable performance on Cloud TPUs. They are effective for most use cases but may offer opportunities for expert tuning to achieve peak (Gold Tier) performance.

[^1]:  Performance results are subject to variations based on system configuration, software versions, and other factors. These benchmarks represent point-in-time measurements under specific conditions.
[^2]:  Some older TFLOPS/s results are impacted by an updated calculation for causal attention ([PR #1988](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/pull/1988)), which halves the attention FLOPs. This change particularly affects configurations with large sequence lengths. For more details, please refer to the [performance metrics guide](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/docs/guides/performance_metrics.md).
