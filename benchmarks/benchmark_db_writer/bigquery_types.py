This module defines enumerations for BigQuery data types (e.g., `STRING`,
`INT64`) and field modes (e.g., `NULLABLE`, `REQUIRED`).

It also defines a primary mapping, `TypeMapping`, which translates these
BigQuery types into their corresponding standard Python types (like `str`, `int`,
`datetime.datetime`). Custom types (`TimeStamp`, `Geography`) are included
for specific BQ types not perfectly represented by Python built-ins.
