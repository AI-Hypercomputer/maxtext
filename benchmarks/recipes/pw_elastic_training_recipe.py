"""A recipe for running an elastic training benchmark with disruptions.

This script configures and launches a MaxText workload on a GKE cluster using XPK,
and then introduces disruptions (e.g., killing pods) to test the resilience
and recovery capabilities of the training job. It can be configured to run
with both Pathways and McJAX to compare their elastic training behavior.
