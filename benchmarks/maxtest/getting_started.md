### Getting starting with using the maxtest tool

*Note: This is currently in preview stage and only supported for v5p and v6e*

The main intent of this tool is to quickly verify whether the provisioned TPU
nodepool can run a Maxtext workload **without having to
use XPK**. This is useful for debugging provisioned nodepools for potential hardware issues.

```shell
bash maxtest.sh \
    --project tpu-test-project \
    --cluster tpu-cluster \
    --region asia-east1 \
    --nodepool tpu-nodepool \
    --num_workers 8 # the nodepool here is a v5p-128 so 8 workers

Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for bodaborg-v6e-32-td-c.
Applying generated configuration to the cluster:
service/headless-svc-87e0b-maxtest created job.batch/87e0b-maxtest created

Job started, visit https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.labels.pod_name%3D~%2287e0b-maxtest%22;duration=PT1H?project=tpu-test-project to view logs
or run: 'kubectl logs job.batch/87e0b-maxtest'
```

-   After running the job, you can check the logs and the exit code to determine
    the outcome. A successful job will end with `EXIT_CODE=0` as well as the
    TFLOPs and step time of each step.

-   maxtest.sh will generate a YAML file in the directory that is passed to kubectl. This file can be modified and re-used by running `kubectl apply -f maxtest.yaml`

### Debugging common job errors ###

If the job does not exit with `EXIT_CODE=0`, there is a failure among one of
the workers or the coordinator VM, this can be debugged by checking the specific
worker logs.

Modify the `pod_name` in Cloud Logs Explorer to the specific worker to view its logs
by hyphenating the `JOB_NAME` with the index of the worker:

```
resource.labels.pod_name=~"87e0b-maxtest-0" #Here 0 indicates the coordinator VM (VM 0) logs and '87e0b-maxtext' is the job name
```

#### Slice Failure / Chip Driver Error ####

A `SLICE_FAILURE_CHIP_DRIVER_ERROR` indicates a problem with one of the TPU workers. The logs from `worker_0` (the coordinator) will show which worker missed the health check.

Use Logs Explorer to view the logs for that specific worker. For example, for worker 38, use the query `resource.labels.pod_name=~"tpu-job-jax-v6e-8-5-38"`. Where `38` is the VM that missed the health check and `tpu-job-jax-v6e-8-5` is the name of the job.

#### An XLA compiler bug or your job hit a bad TPU hardware ####

```
6x2x0_SC1: *** A program or fatal error occurred, all pending programs will fail, and results may be corrupted. This is likely an XLA compiler bug or your job hit a bad TPU hardware. If you suspect a compiler bug please file a bug to xla-tpu@ and CC tfrt-devs@. If the error is repeatedly happening on the same machine and you suspect faulty hardware, consider reporting a bad machine. Physical location: tpu3:pe2:2
```

Action: If you see this error, likely you have a bad TPU hardware issue, attempt to retry the workload a few times to confirm. The bad hardware will be on the same VM as the log is reported on. Delete and recreate the nodepool in this situation.
