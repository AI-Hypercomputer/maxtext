# This script uses a pre-built JAX stable stack Docker image as the BASEIMAGE. This image includes pinned versions of JAX and other core and utility libraries, all of which have been thoroughly tested together.
# It then copies the local source code into the image and uploads it to Google Container Registry (GCR).
# This allows the image to be used for development within GCR.

# Each time you update the base image via a "bash docker_maxtext_jax_stable_stack_image_upload.sh", there will be a slow upload process
# (minutes). However, if you are simply changing local code and not updating dependencies, uploading just takes a few seconds.

# Example command:
# bash docker_maxtext_jax_stable_stack_image_upload.sh PROJECT_ID=sample_project BASEIMAGE=us-docker.pkg.dev/sample-project/jax-stable-stack/tpu:jax0.4.30-rev1 CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME=maxtext-jax-stable-stack IMAGE_TAG=latest MAXTEXT_REQUIREMENTS_FILE=requirements_with_jax_stable_stack.txt
