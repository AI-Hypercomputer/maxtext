"""
Integration tests to check compatibility of checkpoints between different input pipelines.

These tests verify that a checkpoint saved during a training run using one
input pipeline (e.g., 'grain') can be successfully restored and continued
by a subsequent training run using a different input pipeline (e.g., 'tfds').
The tests confirm restoration by checking the starting step of the resumed runs.

Note: Make sure to run
  `bash setup_gcsfuse.sh DATASET_GCS_BUCKET=gs://maxtext-dataset MOUNT_PATH=/tmp/gcsfuse/`
before running tests locally.
