  Attributes:
    pixel_values: A JAX array containing the processed image pixel data.
                  The shape and format depend on the specific model and
                  preprocessing steps (e.g., [H, W, C] for Gemma3 or
                  [NUM_TILES, C, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE] for Llama4).
    pixel_mask: An optional JAX array of shape (NUM_TILES,) indicating valid
                tiles in the image.
    aspect_ratios: An optional JAX array of shape (batch_size, 2) representing
                   the aspect ratio [ratio_h, ratio_w] of the processed image(s).
                   This is particularly relevant for models like Llama4 that handle
                   images by tiling.
