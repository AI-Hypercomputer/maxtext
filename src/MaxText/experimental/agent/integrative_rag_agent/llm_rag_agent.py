This file defines the `EmbeddingAgent` class, which acts as an interface for interacting
with the Google Gemini model. It handles model initialization, configuration, and robust 
API calls with retry mechanisms. Please add your API key and chosen model name in .env file. 

Example Invocation:

```python
from integrative_rag_agent.llm_rag_agent import EmbeddingAgent

# Initialize the EmbeddingAgent
embedding_agent = EmbeddingAgent()

# Generate an embedding for a given text
text_to_embed = "This is a sample text for embedding."
embedding = embedding_agent(text_to_embed)
print(f"Generated embedding: {embedding}")
```
