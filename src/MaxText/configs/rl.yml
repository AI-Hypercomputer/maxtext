# RL Configuration
# This config consolidates common parameters for RL training across different model sizes

# ====== Hardware =====
trainer_devices_fraction: 0.5
sampler_devices_fraction: 0.5
chips_per_vm: 4 # depends on hardware, for v5p this is 4
num_trainer_slices: -1
num_samplers_slices: -1

# ====== Reproducibility ======
data_shuffle_seed: 42

# ====== GRPO ======

# The number of times the policy generates multiple responses for a given prompt
# within a single training step. This corresponds to `G` in Algorithm 1 in the
# paper. The "group" in GRPO comes from here.
num_generations: 2

# === other GRPO configs ===
# The number of iterations per batch (𝜇 in GRPO algo 1).
num_iterations: 1

# The coefficient for the KL divergence penalty (𝛽) in the GRPO loss function.
# Important to keep a high enough value for this, otherwise, the KL divergence
# can increase unchecked.
grpo_beta: 0.08
# Epsilon value for clipping (𝜀 in GRPO loss in paper). Similar to PPO, for
# stable updates.

# ====== Models ======
# for MaxText
# Model and Tokenizer Configuration
# Override these via CLI:
