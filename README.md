# New Project Template

This repository contains a template that can be used to seed a repository for a
new Google open source project.

See [go/releasing](http://go/releasing) (available externally at
https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/releasing) for more information about
releasing a new Google open source project.

This template uses the Apache license, as is Google's default.  See the
documentation for instructions on using alternate license.

## How to use this template

1. Clone it from GitHub.
    * There is no reason to fork it.
1. Create a new local repository and copy the files from this repo into it.
1. Modify README.md and docs/contributing.md to represent your project, not the
   template project.
1. Develop your new project!

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/google/new-project
mkdir my-new-thing
cd my-new-thing
git init
cp -r ../new-project/* ../new-project/.github .
git add *
git commit -a -m 'Boilerplate for new Google open source project'
```

## Source Code Headers

Every file containing source code must include copyright and license
information. This includes any JS/CSS files that you might be serving out to
browsers. (This is to help well-intentioned people avoid accidental copying that
doesn't comply with the license.)
